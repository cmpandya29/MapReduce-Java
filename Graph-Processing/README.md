# Graph Processing using Map-Reduce

This program finds the connected components of any undirected graph and prints the size of these connected components. A connected component of a graph is a subgraph of the graph in which there is a path from any two vertices in the subgraph. For example, there are two connected components: one 0,8,9 and another 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Your program should print the sizes of these connected components: 3 and 7.
